# CLAUDE.md — Hemi Bros ARPG (BroTown)

Read this first. It encodes context that is expensive to rediscover.

## What this repo is

A real-time multiplayer ARPG, fully contained in this one repository:

- **Client** — Vite + React + PixiJS (WebGL). Entry `src/main.jsx`, game
  UI/loop in `src/ui/BroTown.jsx`, rendering in `src/rendering/`,
  networking in `src/net/wsClient.js`, data tables in `src/data/`.
- **Server** — `server/` is a Cloudflare Worker (Durable Objects:
  GameRoom, Marketplace, Leaderboard, Arena, Feedback). See
  `server/README.md` for run/test/deploy/rollback.
- **Docs** — the root `README.md` is the Master Game Design Document
  (GDD), NOT a setup guide; don't put tooling docs in it.
  `docs/specs/*.md` holds implementation specs for shipped features.

The server previously lived in a separate `brotown-server` repo, now
archived. Do not push there or build patches against it.

## Deployment (important)

- **Client:** Cloudflare Pages builds `main` automatically →
  production site. Every PR gets a preview URL posted by the Pages bot.
- **Server:** `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` runs
  `wrangler deploy` from `server/` on any merge to `main` touching
  `server/**`. Requires the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secret.
- **NEVER deploy the worker from a local machine.** A laptop deploy of
  a stale clone on 2026-06-10 rolled back three weeks of server work
  and broke combat in production (the reason this repo is a monorepo).
- Rollback: Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → brotown-server →
  Deployments → rollback. Player data lives in Durable Object storage
  and survives deploys/rollbacks.
- A worker deploy briefly disconnects live players (clients
  auto-reconnect) and cold-starts the room: the first join after a
  deploy may retry its loading screen a few times. One-time per
  deploy; not a bug. Prefer merging server changes at quiet hours.

## Wire protocol

Two protocol versions coexist; both must keep working:

- The client sends `protocolVersion: 2` in the `join` message.
- v2 sessions get: delta `player_state` (changed fields only,
  no-change emits skipped), per-entity monster/node tick deltas,
  merged `zone_state` on zone change.
- v1 (anything that doesn't opt in) gets: full `player_state`
  snapshots, full dirty-zone entity lists, and the legacy
  `zone_monsters`/`zone_nodes`/`zone_loot` trio.
- The client keeps v1 handlers as fallback so it works against any
  worker version. Preserve this on both sides — it is the safety
  property that makes client and server deployable in either order.
- Server is authoritative for damage, HP, loot, XP, inventory. Client
  damage popups are local prediction; `monster_hit` from the server is
  the truth. New client→server events must be denied by default
  unless added deliberately (see `PRIVILEGED_EVENTS` in
  `server/src/index.js`).

## Testing

- Server: `cd server && npm test` — runs
  `test/protocol-v2.test.mjs`, the GameRoom against mocked DO storage
  with one v1 + one v2 session (14 assertions). Extend it when
  touching the wire format.
- Client: no test suite; verify via the PR preview URL. Primary
  platform is **iPhone Safari** — test touch controls, not just
  desktop.

## Conventions

- Code comments carry version tags (e.g. `v2.3.694:`) explaining WHY a
  change exists, often with incident history. Match this style; the
  comments are the project's institutional memory.
- `package.json` version tracks the client version loosely; comment
  tags in code are the finer-grained record.
- The repo owner is new to coding: PRs should be self-contained,
  explained in plain language, and mergeable with one button press.
  Avoid asking them to run terminal commands; prefer doing work in
  sessions and shipping reviewable PRs.

## Known history (June 2026)

- PR #10: client protocol v2 + fixes (beard z-order, remote-player
  facing flip, masked-body-frame prewarm, charge-pie dasharray).
- PR #12: server moved into `server/`, protocol v2 server side,
  auto-deploy workflow.
- The charge-pie "blue static" fix addressed exponent-notation
  `strokeDasharray`; if grainy noise on the pie is ever reported
  again on iOS, the next suspect is the CSS `drop-shadow` filter
  compositing over WebGL.
